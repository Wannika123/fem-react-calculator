## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

React is the language that boggles me the most so far, but now that its concept starts to sink in, I think it's awesome. For me, it's more like HTML and JS put together than another framework of JS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/wgGVVX) - It's not exactly copying, but I study this code before I start working on this project.
- [Example resource 2](https://dev.to/abbeyperini/toggle-dark-mode-in-react-28c9) - Toggle in React.
